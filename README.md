# Libretone

Unofficial iOS application to control Libratone speakers.

This app allows you to control the volume, toggle play/pause or skip tracks,
and play any favourites registered on the device.

Because I don't have a proper Apple developer account, this app is not
distributed on the App Store. You'll need to clone this repository, and run it
once on your device to install it.
